# Speed Reader

This project is a **Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) speed-reading tool** designed to help you read significantly faster than traditional reading.

### How it works
Normal reading is slow because your eyes constantly move across the page, stopping and restarting on each word. These eye movements (called saccades) are the main bottleneck in reading speed.

This tool removes that bottleneck by:
- Displaying **one word at a time**
- Keeping the word **fixed in the centre of the screen**
- Highlighting the **Optimal Recognition Point (ORP)** of each word in red, which is where the brain recognises words fastest

Because your eyes stay locked on a single point, the brain can focus purely on comprehension rather than eye movement.

### Why this lets you read faster
- No horizontal eye movement
- Reduced visual fatigue
- Faster word recognition
- Lower cognitive load
- More consistent reading rhythm

Most readers can comfortably reach **2–3× their normal reading speed** with practice.

### Features
- Adjustable words-per-minute (WPM)
- Pause and resume controls
- ORP (red centre-letter) highlighting
- Works on desktop and mobile browsers
- Can be added to your phone home screen like a native app

This tool is especially useful for scanning long articles, dense study material, or daily reading where speed matters more than rereading lines.

If you want, I can:
- Make it sound more **scientific / academic**
- Add a **short TL;DR**
- Tailor it specifically for **CFA / study use**
- Add a GIF demo section

Just tell me what angle you want.
